<h1>On improving your skills</h1>
Here it is plain and simple. If you want to improve your skills you need to <em>Read , Write and Practice.</em>

<h3>Reading</h3>

<p>You should be aiming to read between 2-3 hours a day outside of school or your normal job. Look for blogs , articles , technical books any source of material that you will enjoy. I like to split my reading sessions up. I will usually try to read something simple or easy. Material that I have already mastered. It serves to keep your skills up to date and to reinforce the stuff that you have already learn't. After I read the "easier stuff" I will look for more challenging material. This is stuff that is new to me and that I am not familiar with. I will read until I am mentally exhausted and then I will take a break. After this l rinse and repeat another day. The idea here is that the difficult material I studied the previous day is now more familiar to me and by reading it again I am reinforcing the learning that has already taken place all the while pushing forward with new challenging material. 
It is important to keep challenging yourself with suitably difficult material.</p>

<h3>Write</h3>

<p>Write a blog or a journal or anything. Take a piece of paper with you when you study and write out challenging stuff. By doing this you are reinforcing your learning. Even better write a technical blog. In researching and preparing your material you are yet again learning new technologies and reinforcing the stuff you already know.</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>
<p>Last but not least. You must <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2012-12-03/news/35550138_1_violin-lessons-suzuki-method-practice">practice</a>.This is the only way you will get better.</p>
