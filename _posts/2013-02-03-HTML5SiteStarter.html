<h1>HTML5SiteStarter </h1>
<p>I finally got around to building a <a href="/html5sitestarter.html">page</a> for the sitestarter project. I used the HTML5Sitestarter template to build the <a href="/html5sitestarter.html">page</a> and have included the source in the examples folder on github. All in all I think it is a great project and I thoroughly enjoyed building every aspect of it. There is certianly room for improvement but for now I am going to move on to build something new. In addition to an examples folder I added the jquery library, less.js and a default favicon . Look out for my upcoming post on using SASS.</p>
