<h1>Why I Started Blogging</h1>

<p>I thought about writing a blog for a little while. I've been spending a lot of time reading blogs and articles from some really good developers. I have come to the realization that the process of writing, preparing and researching for a blog makes you a better developer.</p>

<p>I had read a few articles on using Jekyll as a static site generator and I decided that I would take the opportunity to learn something new while I set up my blog.I read through the documentation and looked at some examples of sites and then I got started. I built out my site and then sliced it and ported it over to jekyll.I ran jekyll and generated my site and uploaded it to my server.It took me about a day to get everything up and running.</p>

<p>If you are looking to become a better developer I would encourage you to start writing a blog if you aren't already doing so, besides that it's just cool to give something  back to the community. So I started blogging as a way to share what I have learn't with others as well as to enhance my own development.I have included the source <a href="https://github.com/reecekol/reecekol.com">here</a></p>
