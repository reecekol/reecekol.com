<p>I graduated school a little over a year and a half ago and since then I have been striving to  become a better developer.One of the many ways I have done so has been to read the blogs of the leaders in web development and Design.Many good developer have taken the time to share what the lessons their Mastery of the craft.I thought about it for a long time and I finally decided to </p>

<p>I had read a few articles on using Jekyll as a  static site generator and  I decided that I would take the opportunity to learn something new while I set up my blog.I read through the documentation and looked at some examples of sites and the  I got started .I built out my site using in a normal folder and ported it over to jekyll.I ran  jekyll and generated my site and uploaded it to my server.It took me about  a day to get everything up and running.</p>

<p>I really believe that by explaing concepts and lessons you have learn't help you to become a better developer,  besides that it is just cool to give something  back to the community.So there you have it I started blogging as a way to share what I have learn't with others as well as to enhancme my own development</p>
