<p>I wanted to learn a little more about HTML5 and some other technologies so I started HTML5SiteStarter as a side project.</p>

<a href="NEMS.pdf">An introduction to Nano Electro Mechanical Systems.</a>
<p>I have alaways been interested in scalable systems. When I was an Undergradaute I spent a <strong>lot</strong> of time researching Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems.
This is a paper I wrote in my senior year supervised by <a href="http://www.egr.msu.edu/~wenli/resume.pdf">Dr Wen Li</a> .</p>

<a href="MEMS.pdf">Fabricating Thermally Actuated MEMS Resonance Sensors for Mass Sensing.</a>
<p>I spent Summer 2010 at the <a href="http://www.engr.du.edu/nemslab/member.html">Integrated Nano Systems Laboratory at Denver University</a>.This is a report on my work fabricating, calibrating and testing Thermally Actuated MEMS Resonance Sensors.</p>
