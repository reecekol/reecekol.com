<a href="NEMS.pdf">HTML5SiteStarter</a>
<p>I wanted to learn a little more about HTML5 and some other technologies so I started HTML5SiteStarter as a side project.</p>

<a href="NEMS.pdf">An introduction to Nano Electro Mechanical Systems</a>
<p>I have alaways been interested in scalable systems. When I was an Undergradaute I spent a <strong>log</strong> of time researching Micro/Nano Electro Mechanical Systems.
This is a paper I wrote in my Senior Year.</p>

<a href="MEMS.pdf">Fabricating Thermally Actuated MEMS Resonance Sensors for mass sensing</a>
<p>I spent Summer 2010 at the Integrated Nano Systems Laboratory at Denver University. This is a report on my work fabricating. calibrating and testing Thermally Actuated MEMS Resonance Sensors</p>
